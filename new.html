              <h2>Undergraduate Research</h2>
              <p>            <p>LIGO operates 4km long interferometers to detect gravitational waves. The first GW detection earned a UCR professor, Dr. Barry Barrish, a nobel prize. 
                I collaborated with researchers to develop an anomaly detection algorithm that clusters time-series data from LIGO auxilary channels. 
                Our method involved generating segmented data from hundreds of physical sensors, run dynamic time warping on the data, employ k-means on time-warped data, and then using cluster matching (hungarian algorithm)
              to monitor the cluster change events. Cluster change events can be interpreted as spurious behavior.</p>

              <h2>LLNL Intern</h2>
              <p>
                Worked in a team including undergraduates, a graduate student, and an LLNL physicist on two physics related computer vision problems.
                The projects included data cleaning, 
                EDA, training, testing / contrasting various machine learning models, and creating visuals.
                <br><br>
                <b>Problem 1: </b>Our first problem was given a supervised learning problem where we had to classify stars vs. galaxies.

                <b>Problem 2:  </b> We created multiple models to spot asteroids in 
                large images of space (using a sliding window). Achieved 97% accuracy in spotting asteroids in unseen testing data. Compared resnet, inception, GMM's, Naive Bayes, and other models.

              <h2>Artificial Intelligence Projects</h2>
              <p>
                Outside of class and work, I've learned machine learning with Jeremy Howards fast.ai course, The HuggingFace Reinforcement Learning course, Practical Deep Learning for Coders by Jeremy Howard, Yoshua Bengio's deep learning textbook, MML (Math for Machine Learning), 
                and other resources. 
                <br><br>
                 Below are some projects
              </p>
  <br><br>
              <h3>A* Search</h3>
              <p>
              Search is a ubiquitous tool in data science. 
              I used multiple different heuristics with A* search to solve the 8 puzzle, comparing their runtime and storage complexity.

              <h3>Feature Selection / Dimensionality Reduction</h3>
              <p> 
              One of my projects in Intro to AI class. After learning about the curse of dimensionality I made a tool that finds the optimal subset of features when using a simple k-means classification model on a dataset of supervised machine learning data.

                <h3>Kaggle Competition: Key Points </h3>
                <p>
                  <b>This is my first Kaggle competition. I will do more!</b> Predicting the location of key points on faces. 
                  <br><br>
                  Built dataloaders and started with a minimum viable CNN. Used a small data subset for rapid iteration using model improvement techniques including: test time augmentation, hyperparameter tuning, gradient accumilation (to save memory), dropout regularization, bagging multiple models and layer freezing (with resnet pretrained values). 
                   <br><br>My final submission used transfer learning with resnet, dropout regularization after the first layer and before the last, gradient accumilation, and hyperparameter tuning  to improve accuracy.

                <h3> Monte Carlo Problem (extra credit in AI class)</h3>
                <p>
                 Monte Carlo approximation is used in many machine learning algorithms. Including reinforcement learning, the famous AlphaGo, and my favorite: Mu Zero. <br><br>
                 
                  Create an equilateral triangle and pick a point randomly on each edge (see below). What is the probability that the point in the center of the large triangle is
                  within the sub-triangle created by the three random points?

                <h3>Optimal Image Compression</h3>
                <p>
                  In data analytics class, a group of classmates and I found the optimal color compression of an image as a project on k-means clustering. K-means was one of the first algorithms used in imagenet.
                  <br><br>My job was finding the optimal k with an elbow finding algorithm.
                   <br>
                   This was a mini-project. I think it's cool to visualize k-means. Now I use elbow finding algorithms all the time!

We ask whether we can catch alignment fakers with interpretability methods and introduce an interpretability benchmark. Submitted to NeurIPS</p>
