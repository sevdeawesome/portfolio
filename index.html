                <p>
                  The Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) is an organization that operates multiple 4km long michelson interferometers to detect gravitational waves. It is the most precise measuring tool ever created. 
                  In 2017, Dr. Barry Barish, a UCR faculty member, won the Nobel prize in physics for leading a team at LIGO to detect a gravitational wave for the first time.
                   Most LIGO research, like mine, is on finding ways to improve the detectors sensitivity to see more gravitational wave causing events (like black hole mergers or supernovae) further out in spacetime.

              <h1>Machine Learning Based Clustering of Auxiliary Channels at LIGO</h1>
                <p>
                  In a project for LIGO, I worked with a team of researchers to develop a machine learning algorithm that would cluster time-series data from the LIGO Auxiliary channels.
                  In this work we proposed to successively apply k-means clustering to data from non-overlapping windows of a set of sensors over a period of time to find groups of similar sensors.
                   We employ Hungarian Algorithm for centroid matching between two independent runs of clustering to obtain approximately consistent set of cluster labels over the whole period. 
                  Consequent windows of time where a sensor switches membership from one cluster to another may point to a change in the sensor's data and hint towards some emergent behaviour in a certain part of the complex system.
                    The goal was to use this to predict anomalous behavior in individual channels, by seeing when it swapped into or out of a conserved recurring pattern. 
                  The algorithm was tested on the data from the LIGO Auxiliary channels. The results were presented at LIGO’s annual international Virgo Kagra meeting.

              <p>
                In a team of 4 undergraduate students, a graduate student, and a Lawrence Livermore Mentor, we solved two machine learning problems and gave a presentation on our results. The projects included cleaning data (set of images in this case), normalizing data, wrangling data, extensive EDA, training and testing various machine learning models, and finally creating meaningful visuals of our results.
                <br>  <br> 
                <b>Problem 1: </b>Our first problem was given a supervised learning dataset of images of nebulae (either galaxies or stars), create a neural network to classify galaxies and stars. The data has 4 channels for different bandwidths from optical filters, so we also identified which wavelengths galaxies and stars emitted the most light and trained models for each photometric band and subset of bands.

                Figure 1. The data set has 4 channels for different bandwidths from optical filters. This is the what the processed data looks like.
                <br><br>
                <b>Problem 2:  </b> Given a dataset of injected asteroids on images from the Keck Observatory, we created multiple image classifying models to spot asteroids hidden in unlabeled data. Our result was a neural network with around a 97% accuracy in spotting asteroids in unseen testing data.

            <h3>A* Search</h3>
            <p>
            Search is a well known, ubiquitous tool in computer science and in data science. A* search is a search algorithm that adds unvisited nodes to a queue in order of a value f(n) -a heuristic distance measure- that assesses how close it is to the solution while considering how far it is from the start. f(n) is the sum of h(n), the value of a heuristic that is created by the programmer and g(n), the distance from the starting node. Since this algorithm is optimal and complete, the only way to create a better search is to create better heuristics for assigning f(n). I used multiple different heuristics to solve the 8 puzzle, comparing their runtime and storage complexity.

            <h3>Feature Selection</h3>
            <p> 
            Often times data has many irrelevant features and irrelevant information. The curse of dimensionality suggests that simple, cleaner data can provide more information than the same data with irrelevant information included. In a project for an Artificial Intelligence course at UC Riverside, I made a tool that finds the optimal subset of features when using a simple k-means classification model on a dataset of supervised machine learning data.

           <h3> Monte Carlo Problem</h3>
           <p>
            Imagine you were to create an equilateral triangle and pick a point randomly on each edge. What is the probability that the point in the center of the large triangle is within the sub-triangle created by the three random points? For an extra credit assignment in an Artificial Intelligence class, I created a quick tool to solve an interesting problem that our professor called “the triangle problem” using the Monte Carlo statistical method because there is no immediately straightforward method to solve this probability without an estimate. The Monte Carlo method is the use of repeated random sampling to obtain a statistical estimate of probability. 
            Though this was a very simple and short project, I believe this is a very powerful tool in a wide range of machine learning problems and thought it would be interesting to include in this section.

          <p>My friends and I regularly play poker and the beginning of the pandemic threw a wrench in our weekly games. 
            Since we didn’t want to pay for rake or premiums from poker websites, one of my friends and I created our own. 
            Our app is a functioning multiplayer poker website with true RNG dealing, a fully integrated chat app, and multiple lobbies/games for scalability. 
            We built it using Node.JS, vanilla javascript and used express/socket IO to handle bidirectional requests. 
            We’re now considering creating bot opponents that can learn bet-sizing and opponent ranges, but for now, it is only available to human players.
            <br>

              I recently graduated from the University of California, Riverside where I studied Physics with a concentration in Computer Science.
               I am most familiar with object oriented programming languages such as JavaScript, C++, Java, and Python and I'm learning machine learning and data science with Python.

  Hi Dr. Papalexakis,

  I’ve enjoyed both the data science challenge and the project with Rutuja this quarter and I’m grateful for these opportunities 
  that you were a part of which got my foot in the door of data science.
